In today’s lesson, we’ll start with a high-level overview of the FDA regulatory process and talk about the intended use followed by a discussion on how to identify and disclose algorithmic limitations. Then, we’ll talk about performance statistics that you will want to use when labeling your device. And finally, how to build an FDA validation plan.

#### Intended use {#intended-use}

The FDA will require you to provide an intended use statement and an indication for use statement. The intended use statement tells the FDA exactly\_what\_your algorithm is used for. Not what it could be used for. And FDA will use this statement to define the risk and class of your algorithm.

#### Indication for use {#indication-for-use}

You can use the indications for use statement to make more\_specific suggestions\_about how your algorithm could be used. Indications for use statement describes precise situations and reasons\_where and why\_you would use this device.
