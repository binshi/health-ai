## Summary {#summary}

This lesson will be a whirlwind tour through sampling theory, signal processing, the Fourier transform, and related topics that you will need to know to complete this course. Along the way, we will learn how to plot and visualize our signals using basic python plotting functions. We will be using the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

If you are familiar with these libraries and concepts already, then this will be mostly a review. If this is all brand new to you, don‚Äôt worry, this lesson assumes zero prior knowledge and doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with the theory. In fact, you won‚Äôt see a single equation in this lesson. You will, however, see a lot of code.

A signal is simply a series of numbers \(e.g. \[3, 4, 6, 2, 4\] is a signal!\). Typically these numbers represent a voltage that changes with respect to some physical phenomenon. When the voltage signal changes in time, it‚Äôs called a time series signal. Signal processing helps us analyze this sequence of numbers so we can learn more about the physical phenomenon it represents.

We can use the figure above to explore some properties of signals. The time-invariant part of the signal is the DC level or mean value \(black line\), here it‚Äôs at 10 Volts. The AC component \(blue line\) is the part of the signal that varies with time. There are many ways to measure the AC component -- e.g., standard deviation, variance, or interquartile range. In this case, we measured the peak-to-peak amplitude, which is 6 volts.

This signal is also periodic, meaning that it repeats itself over and over again. The**period**is the amount of time it takes to make one repetition, which in this case is half a second. The**frequency**is the inverse of the period, or the number of repetitions per second, which is 2**hertz \(Hz\)**.

[![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/March/5e81dbec_phase-shift/phase-shift.png "TODO")Phase Change](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd320-beta/parts/f2d5d3bd-ad72-415e-85e6-208fe1237dfe/modules/b337aa97-ba0a-4a57-8ee6-e15ae15fc987/lessons/27ab2378-4a93-47aa-8740-dc30fc7ced40/concepts/e1e88d78-b8f6-4742-909c-50da547c5566#)

The last property of a periodic signal is the**phase shift**, which is similar to a time shift. If two signals are time shifted by one full period, there is no difference between them. For this reason, we express this shift by the fraction of the period that they are shifted. If a signal is shifted by a quarter of a period, we can say the phase shift is 90 degrees \(360 being a full period\). You can also measure phase shift in radians and there are 2 pi radians in a full period. So this phase shift would be half pi radians.

## New Vocabulary {#new-vocabulary}

* **Period**: The amount of time it takes to make one repetition.
* **Frequency**: The amount of repetitions in a given time period, usually 1 second is the time period.
* **Hertz \(Hz\)**: The units of the sampling rate. 1Hz means 1 sample per second.
* **Phase Shift**: The shift between two similar periodic signals expressed in fractions of a period \(multiplied by 2ùõë radians or 360¬∞\).

# Digital Sampling {#digital-sampling}

The goal of digital sampling is to take an analog continuous-time signal, typically a voltage, and to quantize it and discretize it in time so that we can store it in a finite amount of memory and use the magic of computers to process it. The component that does this is called an**analog-to-digital converter**or an ADC, this is an example of a \*\*transducer, you will learn more about transducers in a future lesson. It is important to learn about the few fundamental ways the ADC changes the analog signal. In our head, it‚Äôs easy sometimes to pretend that we‚Äôre dealing with an ideal analog signal, but this can get us into trouble, and it‚Äôs important to know more detail about how signals are sampled to avoid pitfalls later on.

An ADC encodes a range of physical values to a set of discrete numbers. In this example, the analog signal varies over time between -3V and +3V and we are using a 4-bit ADC, which means that the ADC has 4 bits to encode the range from -3 to +3 \(ie. the**bit-depth**of our sensor is 4\). The 4 bits indicate that there are 16 discrete values and we can see the effect of this quantization in the digitized signal.

[![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/March/5e7a3d4d_nd320-c4-l1-quant-noise/nd320-c4-l1-quant-noise.png "Quantization Noise")Quantization Noise](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd320-beta/parts/f2d5d3bd-ad72-415e-85e6-208fe1237dfe/modules/b337aa97-ba0a-4a57-8ee6-e15ae15fc987/lessons/27ab2378-4a93-47aa-8740-dc30fc7ced40/concepts/26df90b7-2f41-423f-b945-b7c79e2b2b94#)

But typically, ADCs have many more bits and you won‚Äôt see quantization noise because it will be overpowered by other noise sources.

* Latent thermal energy in the system.
* Electronic noise from within the sensor.
* Electronic noise from the surroundings and the building itself. All these types of noise contribute to what we call the
  **noise floor**
  . Even when the incoming signal is perfectly flat, you will see some noise in the output. If you ever see a flat line at 0 in the output, it‚Äôs because your sensor is broken.

This noise is additive, so you‚Äôll see it on top of whatever incoming signal you have.

[![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/March/5e7a3d4b_nd320-c4-l1-additive-noise/nd320-c4-l1-additive-noise.png "Additive Noise. When you combine the previous 2 signals, quantization and noise floor, you will get an additive signal.")Additive Noise](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd320-beta/parts/f2d5d3bd-ad72-415e-85e6-208fe1237dfe/modules/b337aa97-ba0a-4a57-8ee6-e15ae15fc987/lessons/27ab2378-4a93-47aa-8740-dc30fc7ced40/concepts/26df90b7-2f41-423f-b945-b7c79e2b2b94#)

ADCs have a fixed range on the input. So for this example, our ADC was limited to -3V and +3V. This is known as the**dynamic range**of our sensor. When the input signal exceeds the dynamic range of the sensor, in this case from -4 to +4, everything greater than 3 will be clipped and set to 3 and everything smaller than -3 will be clipped to -3. We call this effect clipping, oversaturation, or undersaturation.

And finally, it‚Äôs important to remember that digital signals are sampled periodically in time. We often plot them as these continuous signals by connecting the dots in between, but they are better represented as a sequence of individual points. In this example, there are 30 samples in this second, so we would say the**sampling rate**is 30 samples per second or 30 Hz.

[![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/March/5e7a3d4e_nd320-c4-l1-sampling-rate/nd320-c4-l1-sampling-rate.png "Sampling Rate")Sampling Rate](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd320-beta/parts/f2d5d3bd-ad72-415e-85e6-208fe1237dfe/modules/b337aa97-ba0a-4a57-8ee6-e15ae15fc987/lessons/27ab2378-4a93-47aa-8740-dc30fc7ced40/concepts/26df90b7-2f41-423f-b945-b7c79e2b2b94#)

A sampling rate of 125 Hz means that there are 125 samples per second. The inverse of this is 1 / 125 seconds per sample or 8 milliseconds.

## New Vocabulary {#new-vocabulary}

* **Transducer**: Part of a sensor that converts a physical phenomenon into an electrical one \(e.g., voltage\)
* **Analog-to-Digital Convert \(ADC\)**: A device \(usually embedded in the sensor\) that converts an analog voltage into an array of bits.
* **Bit depth**: The number of bits an ADC uses to create a sample. A 16-bit ADC produces a 16-bit number for each sample.
* **Noise floor**: The total amount of noise in the sensor, including electrical interference from the environment and other parts of the device, thermal noise, and quantization noise.
* **Dynamic range**: The physical range of the sensor. Values outside of this range will show up as clipping in the digital signal.
* **Sampling rate**: The frequency at which a sensor measures a signal.

# Time-domain Plotting Continued {#time-domain-plotting-continued}

Plotting a signal in the**time-domain**just means that the x-axis in our plots is time. This is probably the way you naturally visualize signals. This is in contrast to the frequency domain, which we will see later in this lesson.

We also practice more complicated visualizations like plotting event detections on top of a continuous signal as well as visually comparing two similar signals.

## New Vocabulary {#new-vocabulary}

* **Time-domain**: The typical representation we are used to for signals where the signal is represented by values in time.

## Key Takeaways {#key-takeaways}

* Plotting your data is a great way to check your assumptions about the data you have.
* Matplotilb makes it easy to plot time series signals and events in time together.
