In this lesson we will cover the following:

* Basics of DICOM and NIFTI file formats
* A short introduction into viewing 3D medical images and some of the tools that you can use for viewing. This will be followed by an **exercise**
  where you will be asked to load a 2D DICOM image and convert it into PNG, applying proper windowing transform.
* Some important parameters to consider when analyzing datasets. This will be followed by an **exercise**
  where you will need to load a 3D volume and extract slices from it.
* A walkthrough of a Notebook with an approach to doing exploratory data analysis on a single 3D CT volume, and then an EDA for a dataset of multiple volumes. After that, you will be asked to do another **exercise**
  by working out an approach to an EDA of your own, curating a “dirty” DICOM volume dataset.

As you progress through the material, you may be wondering at times as to why you would need to know the intricacies of DICOM and NIFTI standards. I assure you that understanding how the standard is organized is crucial to understanding the data that you are dealing with. DICOM standard defines not only how pixels are stored, but also how the metadata is stored. A trove of valuable information is contained in DICOM metadata and this information could be used for all sorts of AI tasks - curating dataset, doing rapid QA, routing images to proper models, ensuring confidentiality compliance, etc. Also, if the content still seems too far removed, you might want to jump right into the exercises, and if they become confusing, come back to the lecture material, and use that to put you through.

# The DICOM Standard {#the-dicom-standard}

DICOM stands for “Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine”. It is a standard that defines how medical imaging \(primarily\) data is stored and moved over the network. It’s been around since the '80s and eventual adoption of this standard by all manufacturers of medical imaging equipment has been a huge enabler for medical data interoperability and clinical research in general.

It is an open standard that is maintained by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association \(NEMA\) and is available at[http://dicom.nema.org/](http://dicom.nema.org/). The standard is updated a few times per year, as we update our views on how medical imaging data needs to be stored, and all prior versions are also available. When referencing the DICOM standard in your documentation, it is important to be clear about whether you are referencing the current or past versions of the standard. In this course, I will be referencing version 2020a of the standard.

DICOM is a vast and quite complex standard, and you don’t need to know it all unless you are developing a medical imaging modality or storage software. However, since you are very likely to get data as DICOM, it is important to know what is there, and how to look up things.

In this lesson, we will focus on the storage portion of the standard - the part that defines how the data acquired by the scanners is stored as files on filesystems, and what metadata accompanies these files.

# DICOM Entity-Relationship Model {#dicom-entity-relationship-model}

DICOM standard defines Information Entities that represent various real-world entities and relationships between them. The cornerstone of the DICOM standard are the following objects and relationships:

**Patient**is, naturally, the patient undergoing the imaging study. A patient object contains one or more_studies_.

**Study**- a representation of a “medical study” performed on a patient. You can think of a study as a single visit to a hospital for the purpose of taking one or more images, usually within. A Study contains one or more_series_.

**Series**- a representation of a single “acquisition sweep”. I.e., a CT scanner took multiple slices to compose a 3D image would be one image series. A set of MRI T1 images at different axial levels would also be called one image series. Series, among other things, consists of one or more_instances_.

**Instance**- \(or Image Information Entity instance\) is an entity that represents a single scan, like a 2D image that is a result of filtered backprojection from CT or reconstruction at a given level for MR. Instances contain pixel data and metadata \(Data Elements in DICOM lingo\).

There are many more entities defined by the DICOM standard, but we will focus on these for the purposes of this course. You can look up the comprehensive list in[Section A.1.2 of Part 3](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/html/part03.html#sect_A.1.2)of the standard.

One of the important things to capture here is that per the DICOM standard, 3D medical images are stored as files on a file system where each file represents an instance of Image DICOM Information Entity. In the case of 3D medical images, each such instance shares context with other instances that belong to the same series and same study. Thus, each DICOM file stores metadata that describes attributes of study and series that the respective instance is a part of, and this metadata is replicated across other instances that belong to the same study. DICOM files are usually stored with\_.dcm\_extension and are usually grouped in directories \(but they don’t have to be\) to represent data from series, studies and patients. Relationships between individual .dcm files are defined by the metadata stored within them.

# New Vocabulary {#new-vocabulary}

**SOP**- Service-Object Pair. DICOM standard defines the concept of an Information Object, which is the representation of a real-world persistent object, such as an MRI image \(DICOM Information Objects consist of Information Entities\). The standard also defines the concept of Services that could be performed on Information Objects. One such service is the Storage service \(we will touch on others later in the course\), and a DICOM image stored as a file on a file system is an instance of Storage service performed on an Image Information Object. Such Service-Object Pairs have unique identifiers that help unambiguously define what type of data we are dealing with. A list of SOP Classes can be found in[Part 4 of the Standard](http://dicom.nema.org/MEDICAL/DICOM/2020a/output/chtml/part04/sect_B.5.html). This list is a useful reference for all possible data types that could be stored per the DICOM standard.

**Data Element**- a DICOM metadata “field”, which is uniquely identified by a tuple of integer numbers called_group id\_and\_element id_. The convention is to write the element identifier as group id followed by the element id in parentheses like so: \(0008,0020\) - this one is the DICOM Element for Study Date. DICOM data elements are usually called “tags”. You can find the list of all possible DICOM tags in[Part 6, Chapter 6 of the standard](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part06/chapter_6.html).

**VR**- Value Representation. This is the data type of a DICOM data element. DICOM standard imposes some restrictions on what form the data can take. There are short strings, long strings, integers, floats, datetime types, and more. You can find the reference for DICOM data types in[Part 5, Section 6 of the standard](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part05/sect_6.2.html)

**Data Element Type**- identifiers that are used by Information Object Definitions to specify if Data Elements are mandatory, conditional or optional. Data Element Type reference can be found in[Part 5, Section 7 of the standard](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/html/part05.html#sect_7.4)

**IOD**- Information Object Definition. Information Object Definition specifies what metadata fields have to be in place for a DICOM Information Object to be valid. Scanner manufacturers follow the relevant parts of the DICOM standard when saving the digital data acquired by the scanner. When parsing DICOM data, it is often useful to reference the relevant IODs to see what data elements could be expected in the particular class of information objects, and what they mean. For example, in Part 3 of the standard, you can find[MR Image IOD](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.4.3.html)and[CT Image IOD](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.3.3.html)which we will use in this course quite a bit. You might have noticed that the table with all DICOM data elements does not really provide any description of what these elements mean. The reason for that is that elements may mean slightly different things depending on what Information Object Definition uses them, therefore, to find the real meaning of the element you need to look them up in the respective IOD.

Like DICOM, NIFTI, which stands for Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative, is an open standard that is available at[https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-2](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-2). The standard has started out as a format to store neurological imaging data and has slowly seen a larger adoption across other types of biomedical imaging fields.

Some things that distinguish NIFTI from DICOM, though are:

* NIFTI is optimized to store serial data and thus can store entire image series \(and even study\) in a single file.
* NIFTI is not generated by scanners; therefore, it does not define nearly as many data elements as DICOM does. Compared to DICOM, there are barely any, and mostly they have to do with geometric aspects of the image. Therefore, NIFTI files by themselves can not constitute a valid patient record but could be used to optimize storage, alongside some sort of patient info database.
* NIFTI files have fields that define units of measurements and while DICOM files store all dimensions in mm, it’s always a good idea to check what units of measurement are used by NIFTI.
* When addressing voxels, DICOM uses a
  [_right-handed coordinate system_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule)
  for X, Y and Z axes, while NIFTI uses a
  _left-handed coordinate system_
  . Something to keep in mind, especially when mixing NIFTI and DICOM data.

# Viewing 3D medical images {#viewing-3d-medical-images}

In this section, I will show you briefly two free tools that you could use to view medical images.

## MicroDicom {#microdicom}

One tool is called MicroDicom and is available for Windows OS. This tool is a lightweight DICOM image viewer and provides a very convenient way to explore the DICOM tags.

## 3D Slicer {#3d-slicer}

Another tool is called 3D slicer and is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.It is an open-source modular 3D medical image viewer with a focus on a research community that can view both DICOM and NIFTI. It is quite complex and has a bit of a learning curve to it, but it is very powerful for a variety of tasks.

We have seen a quick intro into a couple of tools that you could use for viewing DICOM images. There are many more, both free and commercial. Slicer is particularly powerful for more advanced scenarios and we will get into it in a later lesson.

If you want to play with these tools now, here are some links:

* Microdicom \(Windows only\): [http://www.microdicom.com/](http://www.microdicom.com/)
* 3D Slicer: [https://www.slicer.org/](https://www.slicer.org/)

Also, here are some other tools that were not covered in the lesson, but could also come in handy:

* Radiant - another medical image viewer: [https://www.radiantviewer.com/](https://www.radiantviewer.com/)
* Osirix \(Mac only\): [https://www.osirix-viewer.com/](https://www.osirix-viewer.com/)
* ViewMyScans - a quick online viewer that doesn’t require a local installation: [https://viewmyscans.com/viewer/](https://viewmyscans.com/viewer/)

We have learned about some of the important parameters that you should be on the lookout for when analyzing medical imaging datasets.

These are parameters that have to do with geometric and photometric aspects of medical images.

## Orientation parameters {#orientation-parameters}

For DICOM two parameters that define the relative position of a 2D in the 3D space would be:

**\(0020,0037\) Image Orientation Patient**- a parameter that stores two vectors \(directional cosines to be precise\) that define the orientation of the first row and first column of the image.

**\(0020,0032\) Image Position Patient**- a parameter that stores x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left-hand corner of the image.

Both of these are Type 1 \(mandatory\) parameters for MR and CT IODs, so it is generally safe to rely on them.

For NIFTI, the same purpose is served by srow\_\*, qoffset\_\* vectors.

## Physical spacing parameters {#physical-spacing-parameters}

**\(0028,0030\) Pixel Spacing**- two values that store the physical distance between centers of pixels across x and y axes.

**\(0018,0050\) Slice Thickness**- thickness of a single slice. Note that this one is a Type 2 \(required, but can be zero\) parameter for CT and MR data. If you find those unavailable, you can deduce slice thickness from IPP parameters. This can happen if your volume has non-uniform slice thickness.

## Photometric parameters {#photometric-parameters}

There are quite a few of those, as DICOM can store both grayscale and color data, so lots of parameters deal with color palettes. CT and MR images usually have monochrome pixel representation \(defined by tag_\(0028,0004\) Photometric Interpretation_\).

Most notable ones of this group are:

**\(0028,0100\) Bits Allocated**- parameter that defines the number of bits allocated per pixel \(since we have CPUs that operate in bytes, this parameter is always a multiple of 8\).

**\(0028,0101\) Bits Stored**- parameter that defines the number of bits that are actually used - quite often, you could see Bits Allocated set to 16, but Bits Stored set to 12.

### Image size parameters {#image-size-parameters}

Of worthy mention are parameters that define the size of the 3D volume. There are Type 1 parameters that define the width and height of each 2D slice:

**\(0020,0010\) Rows**- this is the height of the slice, in voxels

**\(0020,0011\) Columns**- width of the slice, in voxels

Both of these need to be consistent across all DICOM files that comprise a series.

Note that there isn’t really anything in DICOM metadata that has to tell you how many slices you have in the series. There are tags that can hint at this \(like_\(0054,0081\) Number of Slices_, or_\(0020,0013\) Instance Number_\), but none of them are mandatory, Type 1 tags for CT or MR data. The most reliable way to determine the number of slices in the DICOM series is to look at the number of files that you have, and ideally validate that they make up a correct volume by checking for the consistency of IPP values.

# Further Resources {#further-resources}

If you want to dive deeper into the subjects of coordinate spaces for medical images, and parameters of DICOM files in general, some useful resources:

* Section on IPP and IOP parameters in the DICOM standard: [http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part03/sect\_C.7.6.2.html](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.2.html)
* A solid explanation of how coordinate systems work in NIFTI:
  [https://nipy.org/nibabel/coordinate\_systems.html](https://nipy.org/nibabel/coordinate_systems.html)
* A company called Innolitics \(a vendor of various DICOM software\) maintains a great reference of the DICOM standard which sometimes could be quite a bit more convenient than the official standard:
  [https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods)



Methods for dataset analysis basically boil down to using the same tricks as you’d do for individual volume analysis and being on the lookout for inconsistencies in data.

Inconsistencies usually boil down to two classes:

* **Clinical anomalies**- the things related to either anatomical anomalies like missing organs, pathologies like tumors or implants such as limb prosthesis, ports/cannulas, surgical implants, presence of contrast media, etc. Sometimes these things can result in artifacts in the images, so it’s good to be aware of them

* **Informatics anomalies**- things related to specifics of data acquisition or variations in DICOM encoding coming from different scanners. These would be things like slice spacing consistency, image dimensions, variations in photometric encoding, etc

Basic knowledge of DICOM and intuition for what things could go wrong are always useful when analyzing the datasets. I will post some examples of great dataset EDA at the end of this lesson as well.
